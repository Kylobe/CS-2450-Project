UVSim Milestone 3
=================

Description:
------------
This Project simulates Memory & Processor functions. It will take BasicML instructions in a .txt file.
The Program will parse each instruction, execute and output according to the validity of the input.

- Program.cs         → Launches the program
- CPU.cs             → Handles instructions 
- MainMemory.cs      → Loads and stores memory
- text1.txt          → Instructions file

THIS IS A MAC OS PROGRAM ONLY
-----------------------------
 **How to run the Program**

1. Requirements
The following must be installed in order to run the program:

- .NET SDK 6.0 or later

2. Download the proper .zip file for your OS

3. Open terminal and go to downloads directory

4. Unzip file and enter file

> unzip <file-name>.zip && cd <file-name>

5. Grant permissions to run executable file

> chmod +x UVSimGUI

6. Run UVSimGUI

You can also leave file path blank and in that case you will then be asked to input the path to your instructions file (ex: text1.txt)
